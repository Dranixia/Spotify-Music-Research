# Project Name: UCU SEMESTER TASK: Spotify Genres
![](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/docs/logo.png)
Welcome to the Spotify Genres Project

## Description: 
The Spotify Genre Popularity Project uses Spotify Developer Tool: Spotify API to provide users with such information as:

* top genre of the year or multiple years
* info about the whole year, which includes track sample link, their name, genres and authors.
* result of either search by track name or genre
* line graphs with information about genre popularity throughout the history.
  
Information is provided either visually in browser or in command console.

Project is implemented using Python, Python OOP, abstract data types and structures, Python libraries and modules.
All the information about the process of developing and research is available on the project's wiki.
## Contents:
### Main modules:
[main.py]() -- main module to use the program to its fullest in form of menu.

[main_test.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/main_test.py) –– main test module with the actual program, which launches a simulation and gives tutorial for the code.

[music_adt.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/music_adt.py) –– module with Music ADT.

[list.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/list.py) –– module with list data structure.

[linkedlist.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/linkedlist.py) –– module with linked list data structure.

[dictionary.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/dictionary.py) –– module with modified dict data structures.

## Purpose and usage: 
Project's purpose is to make it easier for people who research or are interested in music trends and genres by giving the code to 
use API and receive the information they can research on. Graph with data also 
make it much easier to research tendencies, congruences and changes of the music genres.

In order to use it such modules and libraries should be installed (in addition to project's main modules):
bs4, plotly, spotipy, others are inbuilt.

The graph page is opened locally. The text info is printed in the console of the program you are using to open this project.

## Input/Output data:
All the data is created, loaded and saved automatically, using Spotify's API, with no need in input from the user. 

Output data is represented visually by graphics, or text in the command console.
web apps page.

## Program structure:
To be added.

### Example modules:
[libs_and_modules_usage_example.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/example/lib_and_module_usage_example.py) –– module with examples of libraries and modules usage.

[spotify_api_usage_example.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/example/spotify_api_usage_example.py) –– module with Spotify API usage example.

[adt_usage_example.py](https://github.com/Dranixia/UCU-Semester-Work/blob/master/modules/adt_usage_example.py) –– module with MusicADT usage example.

## Prerequisites: 
Obtaining Spotify's developer key is necessary only for creating already existing JSON file. If you want to do this yourself, you need to create dashboard and get Client ID and Secret. It can be done here: [https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

Install Spotipy, Plotly and BeautifulSoup:

``` pip install bs4 ```

``` pip install spotipy ```

``` pip install plotly ```

## Testing:
There are three modules, provided for testing libraries and modules, used in the project (they should be installed 
on the computer, the module will show, how the data is extracted, used and represented), 
abstract data type Music container (the module demonstrates capabilities of the adt and its functionality, by 
loading data into the adt and showing some visual representations, using adt methods and plotly) and API (the module 
demonstrates, which data can be get with that Spotify API).

They are located in the 'examples' folder.
